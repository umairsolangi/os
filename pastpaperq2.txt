2a: File Manipulation (4 MARKS)
Create a directory named data in your home directory. Inside the data directory, create three subdirectories: documents, images, and backup. Populate the documents directory with three text files of your choice. Provide the commands used for these operations.

# Create a directory named data in your home directory
mkdir ~/data

# Create subdirectories inside the data directory
mkdir ~/data/documents
mkdir ~/data/images
mkdir ~/data/backup

# Populate the documents directory with three text files
echo "This is document 1." > ~/data/documents/doc1.txt
echo "This is document 2." > ~/data/documents/doc2.txt
echo "This is document 3." > ~/data/documents/doc3.txt

2b: Backup Script
Create a shell script named backup_data.sh with the following content:

#!/bin/bash

# Set the source and destination directories
source_dir=~/data
backup_dir=~/data/backup
log_file=~/data/backup_log.txt

# Create a tarball of the source directory
tar -czf "$backup_dir/data_backup_$(date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S').tar.gz" -C "$source_dir" .

# Log the date and time of the backup
echo "Backup completed on $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" >> "$log_file"


chmod +x ~/backup_data.sh
